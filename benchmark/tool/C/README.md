# Inference demo

This is an inference demo program based on the C API of PaddlePaddle.
The demo explained here is based on the C++ code, so we need to use g++ or clang++ to compile.
The demo can be run from the command line and can be used to test the inference performance of various different models.

## Android
To compile and run this demo in an Android environment, please follow the following steps:

1. Refer to [this document](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Paddle/blob/develop/doc/mobile/cross_compiling_for_android_en.md) to compile the Android version of PaddlePaddle. After following the mentioned steps, make install will generate an output directory containing three subdirectories: include, lib, and third_party( `libpaddle_capi_shared.so` will be produced in the `lib` directory).

2. Compile `inference.cc` to an executable program for the Android environment as follows (run in `Mobile/benchmark/tool/C`):
    - For armeabi-v7a
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build

    cmake .. \
    -DANDROID_ABI=armeabi-v7a \
    -DANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN=your/path/to/arm_standalone_toolchain \
    -DPADDLE_ROOT=The output path generated in the first step \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel

    make
    ```
    - For arm64-v8a
    ```
    mkdir build
    cd build

    cmake .. \
    -DANDROID_ABI=arm64-v8a \
    -DANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN=your/path/to/arm64_standalone_toolchain \
    -DPADDLE_ROOT=The output path generated in the first step \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel

    make
    ```

3. Prepare a merged model:   
Models config(.py) (eg: [Mobilenet](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Mobile/blob/develop/models/mobilenet.py)) contain only the structure of our models. A developer can choose [model config here](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Mobile/tree/develop/models) to train their custom models. PaddlePaddle documentation has [several tutorials](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/models) for building and training models. The model parameter file(.tar.gz) will be generated during the training process. There we need to merge the configuration file(.py) and the parameter file(.tar.gz) into a file. Please refer to the [details.](https://github.com/PaddlePaddle/Mobile/tree/develop/tools/merge_config_parameters)

4. Run the demo program by logging into the Android environment via [adb](https://developer.android.google.cn/studio/command-line/adb.html?hl=zh-cn#Enabling) and specifying the PaddlePaddle model from the command line as follows:
	```
	adb push inference mobilenet.paddle /sdcard/test_mobilenet
	adb shell
	cd /sdcard/test_mobilenet
	./inference --merged_model ./mobilenet.paddle --input_size 150528
	```

	**Note:** `input_size` is 150528, cause that the input size of the model is `3 * 224 * 224 = 150528`
